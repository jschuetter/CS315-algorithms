Programming Assignment 2: Trees
Date completed: 27 October 2023

This assignment involved created several class structures: a binary tree Node and two different versions of a binary search tree - the first being a simple BST, the second being a self-balancing red-black tree. Each class has a separate header and implementation file, accompanied by the main file Source.cpp, used to demonstrate functionality.
